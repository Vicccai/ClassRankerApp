# Class Rooster
Feeling lost? Tired of swapping tabs? Don't wing it with Class Rooster!

# Description
Imagine this: you're looking for a course to fullfil an SMR-AS requirement, but nothing seems to match your interests. You've combed through 30 results on Course Roster (with another 35 remaining) and you've already opened 5 tabs of CUReviews and 6 tabs of RateMyProfessor. Preferably, the class you're looking for is easy—since math isn't exactly your strong suit—but you also want a rewarding experience overall. How much long will it take to find this class? Hours? Not if you use Class Rooster! With Class Rooster, we've optimized this process to find your dream class within a couple of simple clicks. You can filter courses by level, requirements, rating, difficulty, workload and even popularity. You can mix and match these filters to find the perfect class for yourself. All of these features come packaged within a seamless user interface that we know you will become very familiar with. Remember, there's no need to wing registration with Class Rooster!
